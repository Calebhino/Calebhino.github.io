						Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset

						Neuroplasticity
					</h3>
					<p>
						Neuroplasticity is the ability
						for your brain to change through
						practice. As you repeat tasks
						the connections in the brain
						begin to strengthen and can form
						new pathways.
						<br /><br />
						Understanding neuroplasticity is
						beneficial because it
						illustrates that practice is the
						important factor in achieving
						what you want and opens people
						up to become better versions of
						themselves.
						<br /><br />
						Personally I can apply my
						understanding of neuroplasticity
						to my work where I feel
						frustrated, scared or inadequate
						by focusing on starting
						something with the understanding
						that the more I do the better I
						will become. I can also use this
						to tackle imposter syndrome
						because I can practice focusing
						on the actual practice instead
						of worrying about failing. Over
						time I hope to encourage failure
						as it allows me to grow.
						<br /><br />
						You can increase your
						neuroplasticity by tackling new
						challenges or crafts and forming
						new pathways throughout the
						brain. Some examples include:
						learning and instrument,
						painting or drawing, meditation,
						and more.

						Growth Mindset
					</h3>
					<p>
						The growth mindset builds off of
						the research of neuroplasticity
						and is a way of approaching
						problems and thinking in
						general. It is about having an
						understanding that our minds are
						malleable and that with practice
						we can grow and become more
						equipped to tackle certain
						problems.
						<br /><br />
						Nothing really surprised me
						during my exploration as it felt
						confirming in my personal
						understanding and my personal
						frustrations with the education
						system I was raised in.
						<br /><br />
						I will integrate the growth
						mindset into my learning as
						discussed above, this mindset is
						building off the understanding
						of neuroplasticity. As I
						continue with the dev academy
						course I can apply this mindset
						and focus on repetition and
						practice with the skills that I
						struggle with.
						<br /><br />

						Effect on my learning plan
					</h3>
					<p>
						With this understanding I can
						approach problems along my
						journey as a piece of the
						journey rather then something to
						tick off or achieve. In my
						learning plan I talked about
						working on something everyday,
						and above I talked about just
						starting something and focusing
						on practicing even if it is
						small amounts. This is always
						something I have struggled with
						as I normally leave my work to
						the last minute as I developed
						habits of minimum effort maximum
						reward during school which
						allowed me to be super lazy.
						During this course I hope to
						practice and focus more on the
						journey and develop my skills
						rather than do the bare minimum.
