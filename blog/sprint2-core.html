						What is your long term goal
						and/or career pathway?
					</h3>
					<p>
						My long term goal is to start my
						own company and work on projects
						that I love and that are ethical
						and work to make a difference. I
						do however intend to work in a
						more traditional software
						developer role first to gain
						practice with the technologies
						we use and to get experience
						working in that environment. I
						do personally hate bureaucracy
						and intend to develop and
						experiment with better ways of
						working when I work on my own
						companies.
					</p>
					<h3
						class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"

						A description of your own
						strengths and limitations in
						relation to learning
					</h3>
					<p>
						I am very curious and passionate
						about things of interest. A lot
						of the skills I have are because
						I was curious enough to
						experiment and teach myself and
						that is especially good because
						I love web dev. I am limited by
						my ability to be interested in
						too many different things and
						find that i get distracted very
						easily. I can also be quite
						intense which can make it
						difficult to work with as i
						struggle with how to communicate
						my different opinion.
					</p>
					<h3
						class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"

						What skills (non-technical -
						human skills) would you like to
						see developed in yourself while
						at EDA?
					</h3>
					<p>
						I'd like to work on my ability
						to communicate my point of view
						and work in a team environment.
						I'd also like to work on
						completing tasks when I have set
						deadlines and agreed to them
						with a team.
					</p>
					<h3
						class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"

						A commitment to how you will
						manage your workload in this
						programme. This should include:
					</h3>
					<p>
						I will manage my workload by
						setting the abstract goal of
						tackling something everyday and
						working as much as I can. I will
						scope out what the weeks
						workload looks like and allocate
						my work time accordingly.
					</p>
					<h4
						class="pl-8 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"
					>
						An explanation of how you will
						manage yourself to work
						productively and safely with
						other learners, facilitators and
						industry/community
						representatives
					</h4>
					<p class="pl-8">
						I will manage myself by setting
						rough boundaries of time to work
						on things and stick to those as
						much as possible. If I go over
						the alloted time I will let
						anyone effected know ahead of
						time if possible.
					</p>
					<h4
						class="pl-8 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"
					>
						What you will do when things are
						building up and starting to get
						to you
					</h4>
					<p class="pl-8">
						I will ask for help if I am
						stuck and identify which tasks
						are easiest to start with so I
						can get into flow and then
						tackle the bigger tasks.
					</p>
					<h3
						class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"
					>
						A commitment as to how and where
						you will seek help in a timely
						way
					</h3>
					<p>
						I will seek help if I have
						explored other options and still
						do not understand something or
						am about to leave the problem
						for a later time.
					</p>
					<h3
						class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"
					>
						A description of what you expect
						from the facilitation team
					</h3>
					<p>
						I expect support during normal
						business hours and help if
						needed.
					</p>
					<h3
						class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"
					>
						Any scheduling information such
						as block-out times when you are
						committed to other things. For
						example, you might have whanau
						commitments like school
						drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to
						plan these in.
					</h3>
					<p>
						I don't really have any
						block-out times, my schedule is
						very flexible and open. I might
						sometimes have to pickup my dog,
						but I can get someone else to do
						it or let people know in
						advance.
