						A time I got blocked on a simple
						problem
					</h3>
					<p>
						During last sprints FreeCodeCamp
						challenges and I got to the
						recursion section. I’ve used
						recursion before and find it
						incredibly elegant in its nature
						but it can also bloody
						complicated. Recursion is
						another way that we can run a
						bit of code over and over again.
						Having not used this method in a
						little while I got caught up
						with a problem when running the
						solution I had come up with. I
						spent a while thinking about the
						issue and why it wasn’t
						happening. I started googling to
						look at some other examples that
						I could model to see if mine was
						in line with others, I also used
						console.log to check my code at
						different points, and even used
						the rubber ducky technique and
						talked to someone else about my
						problem for a little bit. I
						eventually realised that I was
						missing a very simple bit of
						code that meant my solution
						wouldn’t run forever. I felt
						pretty frustrated throughout the
						process as I was pretty
						confident in my recursion
						ability but was frustrated with
						my inability to solve the
						problem. Once I figured out my
						silly mistake I was chuffed. I
						learnt sometimes you just need
						to go back to basics when trying
						to solve a problem, even if you
						think you should be able to
						solve it without.

						A time I solved a problem in an
						elegant way
					</h3>
					<p>
						During this sprints
						“Built-in-Methods” I was writing
						a piece of code that would take
						a series of words and capitalize
						the first letter of each of
						them. To solve this problem I
						used the hints provided and
						googled some premade tools that
						I could include in my solution
						to manipulate the words, when I
						wasn’t sure why it wasn’t
						working I would use console.log
						to let me know what was
						happening at each point.
						Throughout the process I felt
						focused and in flow because I
						was able to breeze through it
						quickly and get fast feedback
						that allowed me to solve the
						problems. Once I finished I sat
						back and thought “wow”, I was
						impressed with how small my
						solution was, but also at how it
						was quite complex. I learnt how
						to compress my code a bit more
						then I might have initially
						done.
