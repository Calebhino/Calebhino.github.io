						What are three new things you
						have learned about yourself and
						your ego as a result of the core
						learning?
					</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							I'm a bit of a
							perfectionist. I've
							found that when I am
							coding i try to find the
							most efficient and
							simple solution
							possible, but sometimes
							this can cause me to
							procrastinate
						</li>
						<li>
							I can be a bit
							egotistical about my
							ability with programming
							and get frustrated when
							I can't figure something
							out
						</li>
						<li>
							Stillness is a real
							challenge for me. I
							always like to be doing
							something, and get bored
							really quickly.
						</li>
					</ol>

						What are the role of values,
						empathy and self awareness in
						learning and programming?
					</h3>
					<p>
						Values, empathy and self
						awareness are all essential to
						learning and programming. Values
						and empathy help define how a
						person interprets information
						and approaches problems, and
						self awareness allows a person
						to observe and acknowledge
						behaviours and make changes
						accordingly for the betterment
						of oneself. These are all useful
						in programming because there is
						an incredible social aspect to
						working in a team, and diversity
						of differences in peoples
						values, empathy levels, etc.
						allow for people to approach
						problems differently.
					</p>

						What has surprised you the most
						about the core learning?
					</h3>
					<p>
						Even though some of the stuff
						felt quit wishwashing it wasn't
						difficult to understand, in fact
						it felt like it confirmed a lot
						of my experiences and it felt
						like it made sense. Because of
						this it made me a little bit
						frustrated with previous
						education systems i've been
						through as I have always felt
						they were inadequate and didn't
						enjoy school other then the
						social elements. <br /><br />I
						also found it difficult
						sometimes to sit and try and
						write down what was happening in
						my head as it never felt
						accurate upon rereading and this
						was suprising because I've never
						really been asked to do that
						before while learning.
					</p>
					<h3
						class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"
					>
						What were the most challenging
						aspects of the core learning?
					</h3>
					<p>
						I found commiting to the
						meditation and mindfullness
						difficult as doing this part of
						the course self paced there
						wasn't a structure that forced
						me to do it which made it
						difficult.
					</p>
					<h3
						class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"
					>
						Why do you think we, a
						programming school, are spending
						so much time focusing on core
						learning in a web development
						bootcamp course?
					</h3>
					<p>
						Because theres quite a
						reputation of programmers
						lacking social skills in
						professional environments and
						because it is incredibly
						important for a team to be able
						to communicate properly.
					</p>
					<h3
						class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2"
					>
						Does the time you spent studying
						core learning here feel like a
						waste of time? Should you have
						just used that time to
						practising programming instead?
						Justify your answer.
					</h3>
					<p>
						I don't think it was a waste of
						time, I did enjoy it less than
						the programming but I gained a
						lot of value out of it, even
						though I found it difficult at
						times to write things out.
