						My Personal Values, Ethics and

						About my values
					</h3>
					<p>
						The most important ethical
						decision in my life happened a
						few years ago when leaving high
						school. I knew I wanted to be
						successful and I wanted to enjoy
						what I do, but I wasn't entirely
						drawn to one path. When I was
						younger I wanted to be an
						inventor and make things, so I
						was interested in engineering,
						but then my brother became an
						engineer and It made it seem
						mundane and uninteresting. Then
						I wanted to be a film maker
						because I've always loved making
						films and it was something I was
						passionate about, there just
						wasn't a great success rate and
						the path wasnt clear, especially
						because I felt the education
						options were lackluster.
						<b
							>Then I started looking
							at Computer Science.</b
						>
						I knew I loved building websites
						and doing graphic design in my
						own time, and i rocked at
						Computer Science in school
						(subtle brag). I decided I
						wanted to study Computer
						Graphics (Computer Science but
						with a focus on animation and
						such) at Victoria University. I
						has my eye on Victoria
						University for a long time, I
						had a desire to go live
						somewhere new that had a vibrant
						culture. During that time I made
						some pretty big personal
						revelations. I realised I really
						wasn't happy with the person I
						was and I didn't feel like the
						people I was around would help
						be the person I wanted to be.
						Because of this I focused on
						meeting new people at university
						and met my best friends, I also
						became really interested in
						psychology and went to study
						that at University alongside
						Computer Graphics. I started
						reading a bunch of self help
						books and finding a few new
						communities. I had reached a
						turning point and I almost
						entirely deconstructed my value
						and belief systems and built
						them back up. I started to
						assume I was always wrong with
						the intention of learning and
						growing. This idea has a few
						flaws but it worked for the most
						part. Because of this "rebirth"
						it set me on the path to become
						involved in a social enterprise
						that I fell in love with. I
						learnt about systems thinking
						and a tremendous amount about
						who I am as a person. I learnt
						about giftedness, self managed
						organisations and a bunch more
						stuff. It accelerated my growth
						by at least 5 years and it made
						me realise i want to creating
						things for the betterment of
						others and that I want to solve
						complex problems.

						<br /><br />
						For a long time I didn't believe
						I actually had a culture because
						it wasnt something ever really
						talked about and what I was
						taught at school about other
						cultures seemed entirely
						seperate from my reality. In the
						past few years during a lot of
						self evaluation I realised that
						my privelige and upbringing
						influenced who I used to be
						quite heavily and have found
						that since then finding others
						with varying opinions and
						experiences has influenced who I
						am today and helped me to
						understand who I am.

						My strengths and limitations
					</h3>
					<p>
						Whenever I do the Myer's Briggs
						test it alternates between
						Campaigner and Mediator with the
						main difference being
						introversion/extroversion.
						<br /><br />
						The strengths listed under
						mediator are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Thoughtful</li>
						<li>Generous</li>
						<li>Open-Minded</li>
						<li>Creative</li>
						<li>Passionate</li>
						<li>Loyal to Their Values</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<br /><br />
						I would say that I agree with
						most of these strengths and have
						found that they allow me to
						provide a different perspective
						then others in professional
						situations. In my last project I
						found that I became a voice of
						ethics among members of our
						team. I also found that my
						open-mindedness allowed me to
						learn and adapt quickly which
						led me to an incrdible amount of
						personal and professional
						growth.
						<br /><br />

						The Weaknesses/Limitations
						listed under mediator are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Overly Idealistic</li>
						<li>Self-critical</li>
						<li>Impractical</li>
						<li>Emotionally Driven</li>
						<li>Conflict-Averse</li>
						<li>
							Difficult to Get to Know
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<br /><br />
						There are a few limitations I
						don't particularly agree with
						and some I think can be
						strengths. However I do agree
						with the self critical limiation
						and I've found my self critical
						nature to be quite destructive
						in professional and personal
						environments. I can be
						incredibly Idealistic which
						sometimes leads to impractical
						ideas, but I have found that a
						lot of the time my creativity
						allows me to find practical
						solutions that work and often
						the impractical nature is deemed
						by other people.
						<br /><br />
						<br /><br />
						I think that my creativity,
						open-mindedness and generous
						values will help me in my
						learning journey as they will
						allow me to work well with
						others while also problem
						solving solutions and taking in
						new ideas easily.
						<br /><br />
						<br /><br />
						During my time working at Kete
						Kai (the social enterprise
						mentioned earlier) I spent a lot
						of time thinking about how as a
						team we could work better
						together. I proposed a lot of
						different ideas and was often
						supported but then nothing came
						of it because It wasn't deemed a
						priority. There was a lot of
						hostility between others in the
						team. One of the strategies that
						we tried later on in our working
						together was a system called
						Deep Democracy. Deep Democracy
						is a method that allows you to
						come to decisions while
						acknowledging and learning about
						other individuals perspectives
						while also adapting the decision
						so that the minority vote holds
						less hostility and can come
						along with the made decision.
						<br />
						In the future I would continue
						to refine my experience with
						Deep Democracy while also
						designing more self managed
						systems of resolving conflict
						and working together. There were
						many ideas i had and didn't get
						to try and implement and one day
						I would like to do so because I
						believe in building systems that
						work for people and I believe
						that the systems we have in
						place in most traditional
						organisations are not sufficient
						and are not designed with people
						in mind.
